# Pandabank

Pandabank is a bank-like application that enables users to perform various banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. The application utilizes a Postgres database to store user account details and transaction records. It was developed as a school project to enhance students' proficiency in C# programming and database connectivity.
